PowerShell offers automation, efficiency, and precision in Microsoft 365 management, surpassing GUI limitations with scripting capabilities, scalability, advanced task automation, boosting productivity and control. 



Access PowerShell on Windows by searching 'PowerShell' in Start menu, or typing 'powershell' in Run dialog box (Windows key + R). Right click on PowerShell and choose Run ISE(Integrated Scripting Environment) as Administrator.



First thing to do in a scripting environment is to check your execution policy with this command: 

- Get-ExecutionPolicy



Depending on the response you get on the CLI, this lets you know if scripting is allowed or restricted on the interface. The responses can either be any of these: 



*Unrestricted, a PowerShell execution policy that allows all scripts to run, regardless of their origin (local or remote).

*Restricted, scripting is not allowed to run in the ISE.

*RemoteSigned, execution policy allows scripts to run if they are either created locally (on your machine) or they are digitally signed by a trusted publisher if they originate from remote sources (like the internet).

*AllSigned, execution policy that requires all scripts (both local and remote) to be digitally signed by a trusted publisher before they can be executed.

*Bypass, nothing is blocked, and there are no warnings or prompts. Use this policy with caution.

*Undefined: No execution policy is set for the scope.
